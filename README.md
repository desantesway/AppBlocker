# BlockApps

A Python Script that blocks apps and websites given a schedule for both Windows and Linux.

It is made in a way that it is almost impossible to break it. I've developed this, because every app of this type is paid in some way and I wanted some sort of this to help me focus in my studies and work (which helped a lot).
